# nDistro

 Node distribution shell script. _nDistro_ allows you to build your own
 [node](http://nodejs.org) distribution using a simple configuration file, without 
depending on large programs. To contribute a node binary head over to [nodes](http://github.com/visionmedia/nodes).

## Installation

curl:

     $ cd /usr/local/bin && curl https://github.com/visionmedia/ndistro/raw/master/install | sh

npm:

    $ npm install ndistro

## Example distribution

 A _nDistro_ is simply a dotfile named _.ndistro_ which defines
 module and node binary version dependencies. In the example
below we specify the node binary version _0.1.102_, as well as
several 3rd party modules.

	node 0.1.102
	module senchalabs connect
	module visionmedia express 1.0.0beta2
	module visionmedia connect-form
	module visionmedia connect-redis
	module visionmedia jade
	module visionmedia ejs
	module learnboost node-canvas 0.4.0 canvas

Follow the installation step above to gain access to the _ndistro_ executable,
and then in your distro directory that contains _.ndistro_ run:

    $ ndistro

## Sharing Distributions

To share distributions create a _.ndistro_ GitHub repository,
after which you can push several distributions, for some
examples view mine [here](http://github.com/visionmedia/.ndistro).

To list a user's distributions execute:

    $ ndistro visionmedia

To install one to the **CWD** run:

    $ ndistro visionmedia redis
or
    $ ndistro visionmedia express

## Updating A Library

Updating a library with nDistro is easy, first remove it:

    $ rm -fr modules/express

then execute `ndistro` again:

    $ ndistro

or if you wish to have a clean start and re-install everything:

    $ rm -fr bin modules && ndistro

## node <version>

  Specifies the _version_ of node to install.

    node 0.1.102

## module &lt;user&gt; &lt;project&gt; [version] [alias]
	
  Installs _user_'s _project_ at the given _version_ or **HEAD**.

    module visionmedia express
    module visionmedia express 1.0.0beta2
	  module felixge node-formidable master formidable

## Requiring Your Modules

  When executing `./bin/node`, node will first look at `../lib/node` for modules, which means when you install modules via ndistro, you do not need to require() them relative, you may simply `require('express')` etc.
